Nodal Forces and Moments
Forces reported are the forces at the node acting on the element;  these may differ from
the forces reported for element ends when the element has end releases or is offset.
"When reported in local output axes, forces are in element local directions related to the node and +ve axial forces are tensile."
2D elements are not considered.

Beam End Relative Rotations
Rotations are relative to the attached node.
Only elements with rotational releases about the yy axis are considered.

This table is empty.

Beam and Spring Forces and Moments
The force in an element at any point is the force required to maintain
equilibrium if the element is cut at that point and the end 2 part of the
element is discarded.  Thus:     +ve axial forces are tensile
Forces and moments are output in element axis directions
i.e. Fx: axial force;  Fy & Fz: shear forces;  Mxx: torsion;  Myy & Mzz: moments
Element axes for springs are as defined by the spring property axis no.

Beam Stresses
"The ‘Stress Calc. Basis’ is reported only for sections that have modified Area, Iyy or Izz"
to indicate whether the modified or unmodified properties have been used in the stress calculation.

+ve stresses:  tensile

Axial stress:
A = Fx/Area

Shear stresses:
Sy = Fy/Ay
Sz = Fz/Az
- where Ay and Az are the shear areas calculated in accordance with BS5950-1:2000 4.2.3
  If modified properties are being used then Ay and Az are factored by (mod. Area / base Area).
  Note that torsional stresses are ignored.

Bending stresses:
For sections that have Iyz=0:
By = Myy/Iyy x Dz
Bz = -Mzz/Izz x Dy
- where Dz & Dy are the distances from the centroid to the edge of the
  section in the +ve z and y directions respectively.
For sections that have non-zero Iyz: refer to the GSA manual.

Combined stresses:
"C1 (or C2) = A + B(y,z)"
"- where (y,z) is the position yielding the max. (or min.) bending stress By + Bz"
Thus for rect. and I sections:
C1 = A + |By| + |Bz|
C2 = A - |By| - |Bz|

Only axial stresses are output for explicit sections.
C1 and C2 stresses are not calculated for cases with enveloping operators in them.

Beam Derived Stresses
"Stresses are calculated only for elements that have unmodified Area, Iyy and Izz or for which"
the ‘Stress Calc. Basis’ is specified as ‘Section’.
"The ‘Stress Calc. Basis’ is reported only for sections that have modified Area, Iyy or Izz."

+ve stresses:  tensile

SEy and SEz are the maximum elastic shear stresses.  (Refer to the GSA manual for details.)

Torsional stress:  St = Mxx/Ct
- where Ct is the ‘torsion modulus’.  (Refer to the GSA manual for details.)

Von Mises stress:  This is calculated assuming the maximum through thickness stress and torsional stress coexist.
In most cases this is an over-estimate of the von Mises stress.
Von Mises stress is not calculated for cases with enveloping operators in them.
